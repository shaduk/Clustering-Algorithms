# Clustering-Algorithms
Implemented three clustering algorithms: K-means, hierarchical agglomerative clustering with single link (Min), and density-based clustering to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression profiles. Compared the performance of each of the algorithms using external Rand index and visualized the clustering results using PCA.
